400g flour (3 1/3 cups)
2 tsp baking powder (10 grams)
420 g yoghurt (1 3/4 cups)
condiments (salt and pepper, also things like onion and garlic powder)

mix those 4 ingredients until dough

then turn that dough into a ball

cut it into 8 equal balls (each one roughly weighing 105 grams)

flatten the dough balls

place filling on top (the filling can be anything from the egg and bacon in this video or you can experiment and try different things, like cheeses and meats, however if you do add meat you will have to cook it before placing it as a filling)

seal the dough balls (kind of like bao or hot pocket)

cook on a stovetop on low-medium heat (around 190Â°C) for 5 to 6 minutes each side (i would recommend covering the pan with a pot lid so that the heat gets trapped inside and cooks the sides, as in the video if you look closely they look undercooked)
