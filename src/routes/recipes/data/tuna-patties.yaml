name: Tuna Patties
ingredients:
  For the patties:
    - 2 (5 to 6-ounce) cans tuna
    - 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
    - 1/2 cup white bread, torn into small pieces
    - 1 teaspoon lemon zest
    - 1 tablespoon lemon juice
    - 1 tablespoon water, or liquid from the cans of tuna
    - 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
    - 2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives, green onions, or shallots
    - Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
    - Crystal or Tabasco hot sauce, to taste
    - 1 raw egg
  For cooking:
    - 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
    - 1/2 teaspoon butter
  For serving (optional):
    - Lemon wedges
steps:
  - Drain the liquid from the tuna cans. If you are using tuna packed in water, reserve a tablespoon of the tuna water, and add a teaspoon of olive oil to the tuna mixture in the next step.
  - In a medium bowl, combine the tuna, mustard, torn white bread, lemon zest, lemon juice, water, parsley, chives, and hot sauce. Sprinkle on some salt and freshly ground black pepper. Taste the mixture before adding the egg to see if it needs more seasoning to your taste. Mix in the egg.
  - Divide the mixture into 4 parts. With each part, form into a ball and then flatten into a patty. Place onto a wax paper-lined tray and chill for an hour. (You can skip the chilling if you are short on time. Chilling just helps the patties stay together when you cook them.)
  - Heat the olive oil and a little butter (for taste) in a cast iron or stick-free skillet on medium high. Gently place the patties in the pan, and cook until nicely browned, 3 to 4 minutes on each side.
  - Serve with wedges of lemon. You can also serve with tartar sauce on slider buns for a tuna burger.
