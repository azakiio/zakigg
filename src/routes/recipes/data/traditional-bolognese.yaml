name: Traditional Bolognese sauce
ingredients:
  - 1lb ground beef
  - 150g sliced pancetta
  - 1/2 onion (60g), **finely chopped**
  - 1 medium carrot (60g), finely chopped
  - 1 celery stalk (60g), finely chopped
  - ½ cup of red or white wine
  - 200g Strained tomatoes
  - 1 tbsp Tomato paste (double-concentrated)
  - ½ cup (1 glass) of whole milk (optional)
  - Light meat or vegetable broth (or stock cubes)
  - 3 tbsp Extra virgin olive oil
  - Salt and pepper
steps:
  - In a heavy non-stick 10-inch (24-26cm) casserole (aluminium or enamelled cast-iron (Dutch oven) or terracotta saucepans can be used), melt the ground or chopped pancetta with olive oil.
  - Finely chop the onion, celery, and carrot (do not use a food processor); add the vegetables to the oil and pancetta and cook over low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon until softened but not browned.
  - Raise the heat to medium and add the meat, break it up, then cook for about ten minutes, always stirring, until it sizzles and browns.
  - Add the wine; cook over medium heat until it has completely evaporated.
  - Add the tomato paste and purée. Mix well; add a cup of boiling stock (or water) and simmer, covered, for about 2 hours (or 3 depending on preference and type of meat), adding hot broth (or water) as needed.
  - Add any milk (traditionally used) half way through the cooking; allow to evaporate completely.
  - Season with salt and pepper before serving. When ready the sauce will be a rich maroon hue, thick and glossy.
