- **Invest in Quality**  
  Buy the best quality you can afford for:

  - **Chef's knife** – Your most-used tool (80% of the time).
  - **Stainless steel skillet** – 12 inches or larger for versatility.
  - **Stainless steel pot** – Choose a size that fits your typical cooking needs (e.g., 3-5 quarts for most households).

- **Essential Tools**

  - **Mixing and turning tool** – Something to stir, mix, and turn food (e.g., spatula, spoon). Material is personal preference (wood, silicone, etc.).
  - **Strainer** – For draining pasta, rinsing veggies, etc.
  - **Tongs** – Versatile for flipping, grabbing, and serving.
  - **Ladle** – For soups, stews, and serving liquids.
  - **Graters** – One larger grater (box grater) and a fine one (microplane) for zesting and grating smaller items.
  - **(Optional: Potato masher)** – Depending on your cooking style.

- **Useful Kitchen-Adjacent Tools**

  - **Kitchen scissors** – For cutting herbs, packaging, etc.
  - **Reusable storage bags or containers** – For leftovers and organization.
  - **Kitchen towels** – Reusable, absorbent towels for cleanup and drying.

- **Work Efficiently**
  - Your **cutting board** should ideally be part of your counter setup, cleaned in place after use.
  - **Clean as you go** – Keep your workspace tidy by washing tools immediately after use, so everything is ready when you need it.
  - **Store sponge inside or over sink** - Something like this
