	<p>My attempt at tackling this common design pattern.</p>
	<!--more-->
	<p>
		You don't have to look far on the internet to come across <strong>tabs</strong> or
		<strong>carousels</strong>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Almost any website I work on these days includes at least one of them. I've seen dozens of
		implementations, and yet there always seems to be something missing.
	</p>
	<p><strong>So I decided to give it a go myself.</strong></p>
	<p>
		The goal here isn't to replace the numerous carousel and tab libraries out there. <br />
		Instead, I'd just like to explore what's possible using some basic CSS and JavaScript.
	</p>
	<ScrollingTabs />
	<h2 class="H3">Bloopers</h2>

	<p>
		I would have loved to implement a version without JavaScript, using anchor tags as triggers — <code
			>{'<a href="#slide-id"...'}</code
		> (which I did).
	</p>

	<p><strong>However, it's a bit limited:</strong></p>
	<ul class="list-disc-outside mb-4 p-s-5">
		<li>
			Most browsers first scroll the entire page to the anchor, then to the correct slide. In some
			cases, this behavior might be desired, but it's not ideal for a carousel.
		</li>
		<li>The slides don’t always line up correctly (you may notice the border being cut off).</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		I think we need at least some JavaScript for a fully functional carousel. Nonetheless, I’ve
		shared the implementation below if you’d like to experiment with it.
	</p>
	<ScrollingTabsAnchors />
	<h2 class="H3">That's a wrap!</h2>
	<p>
		I hope you learned something from this <em>Craft.</em> I had a lot of fun putting it together :)
	</p>
	<p>
		Digging into this UI pattern and experimenting with different approaches has given me a new
		appreciation for what goes into making a proper tabs or carousel library.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm fairly new to making these Craft pages, but I'm excited to share more of my experiments with
		you down the road.
