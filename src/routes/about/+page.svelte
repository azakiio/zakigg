		Developing skill through doing, guiltlessly exploring passion and interests, imbuing quality.
		Mindful that
		<em>everything around me is someone’s life work.</em>

		I love building websites. Typography, motion design, copywriting, performance — the web is an
		endless medium of opportunity and creativity of which I’ve only scratched the surface.
